compile with:
gcc lab3.c -o lab3 -lpthread -lrt
run with:
lab3 <seconds to sleep> <number of producers> <number of consumers>

NOTES:
This is a multithreaded program using POSIX threads. It implements a producer-consumer situation. This program best shows that I understand multithreaded programming and how to use semaphores.

I wrote all of the code here myself
