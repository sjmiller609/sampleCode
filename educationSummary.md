New plan: taking classes in the summer and graduating August 7, 2016.
I am actively seeking employment for the autumn. I'm looking for something educational.
Areas of most interest:
*	systems programming
*	network programming
*	information security

> I am taking a ton of interesting classes, I'm glad to increase my workload from last semester. I'm doing a lot of systems and networking work. I'm taking Mobile Systems and Networks, Network Programming, Network Security, Computer Architecture, and computer ethics. The Network Programming class has been the most fun, mostly because it's an coding-based class (more coding than lectures/exam focused). For the final project, we are implementing TCP with UDP using C. This is great since I get systems programming (low-level, multithreaded, and such) and network programming (protocols) experience at the same time. The other classes are still in the lecture stage, so we'll see how the projects go. I also bought the nmap book and I'm working my way though that. Super fun!

I am looking for an internship / co-op for the Spring / Summer of 2016.

> This summer I worked for Doc Halo, a company that provides a HIPAA-compliant communication platform for doctors. I worked with the dev team on site maintenance (MVC ASP .NET C#) and was also responsible for developing a Windows desktop application that notifies users when they have unread Doc Halo messages. I was given a beta version of the application that was developed in Windows Forms with Visual Basic and was told "we hate VB and this doesn't work. Make this C#". So I converted the application into C#, making changes to improve the stability and front-end of the application. Eventually, I realized that converting into C# was not what was really needed, we needed to use a different framework. So I ran it by the team and they agreed that I should switch the project over to Windows Presentation Foundation, which was far superior on the front-end. I converted the application to WPF, and added new authentication features for Single Sign On with SAML 2.0 which involved launching an embedded web browser and extracting information which was not conventionally available through the framework's very limited browser control. I liked working for Doc Halo because I had a lot of free reign over how to reach goals that were set for me. The work involved a lot of me figuring things out for the first time and testing software across different Windows platforms. I would be interested in experiencing a work environment where I develop more cooperatively with my peers.

 Now I will now candidly summarize my educational experience in a blog-like fashion.

> #### first coded
> 
> I first coded in the introductory engineering courses freshman year (C++). I didn't think too much of it: I was pre-med Biomedical Engineering. In BME I did some computer-related stuff like FLUENT (a fluid simulator), MATLAB, plenty of CAD, etc. I thought that it was boring, but maybe I only thought that because I didn't think that it would matter in the long run (planning on being doctor). 
> 
> #### 3 years of pre-med
> 
> I did a lot of undergrad science classes - all the pre-med ones plus engineering classes. I could apply to medical school today and I would have a good chance of getting in. I got a 31 on the MCAT. I studied, worked out, goofed off, the normal undergrad experience. Also, I did a lot of research and lab work outside of class that is explained on my LinkedIn page <https://www.linkedin.com/pub/steven-miller/67/531/4b6>. My first three years in undergrad give me an educational breadth that is much wider than the average CSE student's.
> 
> #### switching out of BME
> 
> Through 2013, I was becoming disillusioned with the idea of pursuing a career in medicine. A lot of it I loved: chemistry and organic chemistry, physics, calculus. Those subjects were great fun for me and I did extremely well. What I didn't like was memorizing a ton of different types of amino acids or memorizing anatomy. I sort of realized that I prefer the math-type "puzzle" subjects to the "memorize and regurgitate" subjects. After a bit of trial-and-error (I first switched into Physics at University of Cincinnati), I ended up trying out CSE back at Ohio State.
> 
> #### starting out in CSE 
> 
> After I got a bit into the subject, I realized that CSE was my calling. The logic and creation is something that I find extremely rewarding. It's a trade, and your personal skill and creativity is what determines your success.
> 
> #### experience programming Java
> 
> I learned to program first in Java in the Software I and II classes at OSU. Concurrently, I was studying Foundations, which is a class sequence that teaches the basics of computer science: run-time, data structures, algorithms, etc. I think that the OSU classes are designed to teach students the fundamentals of programming such that we are flexible at learning new languages. Some Java code from Software II that I wrote is included in this repository.
> 
> #### experience programming C and this most recent semester
> 
> Another class sequence is called "Systems", which focuses on computer system design, C, and assembly. When I started taking Systems is when I started using Linux. I have spent a lot of my free time since then on my Linux machines and tinkering around trying to figure out just how computers actually work. Operating systems are fun for me. My interest in C, Assembly, and Systems has lead me to believe that security could be a future focus for me. This semester I am taking Systems 2 (intro to operating systems), Intro to Cryptography, Information Security, and Networking with that in mind. Also, I have an internship lined-up for this summer related to security. It's a HIPAA-compliant crypto-texting app called Doc-Halo. The company has since expanded past just crypto-texting, and I'm excited to work and learn this summer. I have practiced C in my Systems classes, and some C and Assembly is included in this repository. I am considering taking an online course this summer in penetration testing to learn more about the IT/security field. The class is called "Penetration Testing with Kali Linux". People online say that it's extremely hard, but I think I would be fine.

> #### what I am lacking, what I am looking for
> 
> Usually CSE students take their curriculum interspersed with their general education requirements. I already finished nearly all the non-CSE courses that are required to graduate, so I have just been taking CSE classes only since Autumn 2013 (plus one electrical engineering course). As a result, I have advanced my computer science knowledge very quickly. I think that a downside to this is that I haven't had a chance to work in an internship or co-op related to computer science yet. What I'm missing right now, and hope to gain this summer, is experience working with large projects. I have done a lot of 10-30 hour projects for school, but I haven't done much in terms of large-scale development. I am now looking to take my general experience from school and see how productive I can be on specific projects.
> 
> #### plans for future
> 
>  I plan on continuing to explore different aspects of computer science. I consider at least the next ten years of my life to be "educational" regardless of what I am doing, because I need to master a skill. I have many different paths that I could choose, but I will only select paths where I learn.
