All of these are projects from SoftwareII. There was a strong emphasis on "contracting" methods, which is basically mathematically exact directions for methods.

These projects were done with a partner.

It should be noted that these projects were written while I was learning to code in the first place. They are designed to teach about implementation and best practice for certain situations.
