this script alerts the user when items of a certain type are sold from any CVS near a location.

My buddy and I were thinking about designing some vending machines that have a very large selection. Basically we were thinking about staff-less, low-cost, drive-thru mini-marts
This script is the result of my looking around CVS' website to see what sort of business data might be useful.

It takes 3 input parameters, <item> <location> <item count>
	item: any item description, this will be sent to CVS' product search and will it will scrape <item count> product IDs from the results
	location: the script will check for inventory near this location. any location you could put in google maps should work
	item count: how many product IDs to get

this script only uses publicly available data and limits request rate: legal and not intrusive!
	although I did have to look at server response data to discover that inventory values are leaked for all items in all CVS locations
	kind of seems like a bad idea to leak that info considering that this could hypothetically be used by a competitor to track all store sales of all items

limitations:

cannot alert user for any item sold in a region, can only check by search keyword or specific item (using skuid as <item> argument)
precision of time sold is traded off with number of items scanned
iterates through items checking their availability in store, lets you know when inventory amount changes
this script is not very robust against failure and also is not very well organized, but that's ok since I am the only user and developer
