Harry Potter protocol is in reference to Hogwarts' repeated, escalating-on-failure packet delivery system

just run
%ftps.py 5553
on one machine, then
%troll.py 5554 <between 0 and 100> &      (0 to 100 is percent packet loss)
and
%ftpc.py <ip printed out at server> 5553 5554 test.jpg
on a different machine.

be patient on lossy connection, the last few packets might take a sec to get across.
