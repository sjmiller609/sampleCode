### Lessons Learned from Project 1

* README:         2/2
* Documentation:  4/5
* Work Balance:   8/10
* Testing:        3/5
* Implementation: 70/78

**Points Lost from...**

_Documentation_
* (-1/5) More comments in main logic; methods and classes were good

_Work Balance_
* (-2/10) Fairly well, but could be improved


_Testing_
* (-2) Classes should be imported from separate files

_Implementation_
(-8/70)
* Classes should be imported from separate files  
* More use of classes to encapsulate logic  
* Be careful about nesting too much  
* Refactor code into less lines / more efficiency where possible  
* Wrap long lines
