assuming the array is loaded in memory and we have the size of the array:

the array is circularly sorted, let's find where the lowest value is
	can do this is log(n) with a binary search

then, determine which direction the array is going
	this should take C

then, find integer with binary search

this should result in a program of asymptotic complexity log(n)
ideas for improvements: there is probably a way to implement the find lowest and find integer in the same algorithm, and it will be clear when I've got this part
