This project is still in progress.
	timer-process.c implements a delta-timer
	tcpd.c was just a start to getting organized
	everything else is not going to be part of te final result probably

to run the program:

compile with:
$ make 

then, in one shell check the local ip address using 
$ hostname -i

the output is the server ip (remote-ip in the next part). then, do

$ tcpd server &
$ ftps

in a separate shell, on a differnt machine run
$ troll 1338 -x 0 &
$ tcpd <ip from other shell> &
$ ftpc <file to transfer>

the output file will end up here: ./recv/<local-file-to-transfer>

ftps.c is the server side code
ftpc.c is the client side code
tcpd.c is the daemon
