TLDR:
I have organized some code I have written in this directory's subdirectories so that potential employers (or anyone) can get an idea of my progress.
When you get into a directory, read the README, if one exists. They are not as long as this.
The code I have written in C is most recent, and is therefore the most mature.
I plan to update this file whenever I add some new code to this repo.

4/14/2015:

Now I will now candidly summarize my educational experience in a blog-like fashion.
I will "comment" the subject of each paragraph with //

//first coded
I first coded in the introductory engineering courses freshman year (C++). I didn't think too much of it: I was pre-med Biomedical Engineering. In BME I did some computer-related stuff like FLUENT (a fluid simulator), MATLAB, plenty of CAD, etc. I thought that it was boring, but maybe I only thought that because I didn't think that it would matter in the long run (planning on being doctor). 

//3 years of pre-med
I did a lot of undergrad science classes - all the pre-med ones plus engineering classes. I could apply to medical school today and I would have a good chance of getting in. I got a 31 on the MCAT. I studied, worked out, goofed off, the normal undergrad experience. Also, I did a lot of research and lab work outside of class that is explained on my LinkedIn page <https://www.linkedin.com/pub/steven-miller/67/531/4b6>. My first three years in undergrad give me an educational breadth that is much wider than the average CSE student's.

//switching out of BME
Through 2013, I was becoming disillusioned with the idea of pursuing a career in medicine. A lot of it I loved: chemistry and organic chemistry, physics, calculus. Those subjects were great fun for me and I did extremely well. What I didn't like was memorizing a ton of different types of amino acids or memorizing anatomy. I sort of realized that I prefer the math-type "puzzle" subjects to the "memorize and regurgitate" subjects. After a bit of trial-and-error (I first switched into Physics at University of Cincinnati), I ended up trying out CSE back at Ohio State.

//starting out in CSE 
After I got a bit into the subject, I realized that CSE was my calling. The logic and creation is something that I find extremely rewarding. It's a trade, and your personal skill and creativity is what determines your success.

//experience programming Java
I learned to program first in Java in the Software I and II classes at OSU. Concurrently, I was studying Foundations, which is a class sequence that teaches the basics of computer science: run-time, data structures, algorithms, etc. I think that the OSU classes are designed to teach students the fundamentals of programming such that we are flexible at learning new languages. Some Java code from Software II that I wrote is included in this repository.

//experience programming C and this most recent semester
Another class sequence is called "Systems", which focuses on computer system design, C, and assembly. When I started taking Systems is when I started using Linux. I have spent a lot of my free time since then on my Linux machines and tinkering around trying to figure out just how computers actually work. Operating systems are fun for me. My interest in C, Assembly, and Systems has lead me to believe that security could be a future focus for me. This semester I am taking Systems 2 (intro to operating systems), Intro to Cryptography, Information Security, and Networking with that in mind. Also, I have an internship lined-up for this summer related to security. It's a HIPAA-compliant crypto-texting app called Doc-Halo. The company has since expanded past just crypto-texting, and I'm excited to work and learn this summer. I have practiced C in my Systems classes, and some C and Assembly is included in this repository. I am considering taking an online course this summer in penetration testing to learn more about the IT/security field. The class is called "Penetration Testing with Kali Linux". People online say that it's extremely hard, but I think I would be fine.

//what I am lacking, what I am looking for
Usually CSE students take their curriculum interspersed with their general education requirements. I already finished nearly all the non-CSE courses that are required to graduate, so I have just been taking CSE classes only since Autumn 2013 (plus one electrical engineering course). As a result, I have advanced my computer science knowledge very quickly. I think that a downside to this is that I haven't had a chance to work in an internship or co-op related to computer science yet. What I'm missing right now, and hope to gain this summer, is experience working with large projects. I have done a lot of 10-30 hour projects for school, but I haven't done much in terms of large-scale development. I am now looking to take my general experience from school and see how productive I can be on specific projects.

//plans for future
 I plan on continuing to explore different aspects of computer science. I consider at least the next ten years of my life to be "educational" regardless of what I am doing, because I need to master a skill. I have many different paths that I could choose, but I will only select paths where I learn.
